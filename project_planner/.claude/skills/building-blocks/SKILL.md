# Building Blocks Specification

## Overview

Building blocks are discrete, independently buildable components that together form a complete software system. This skill helps you decompose projects into well-specified blocks that Claude Code can build incrementally, with clear interfaces, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Decomposing a system into buildable components
- Creating detailed component specifications
- Defining interfaces between components
- Specifying API contracts and events
- Estimating effort and complexity
- Planning incremental delivery

## Visual Enhancement with Project Diagrams

**When documenting building blocks, always include diagrams.**

Use the **project-diagrams** skill to generate:
- Component dependency diagrams
- Interface contract visualizations
- Data flow between components
- Build sequence diagrams

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "diagram description" -o diagrams/output.png
```

## Building Block Framework

### Block Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **frontend** | User interface components | Dashboard, Forms, Navigation |
| **backend** | Server-side services | Auth Service, API Gateway, Business Logic |
| **infrastructure** | Platform and DevOps | CI/CD, Monitoring, Database Setup |
| **integration** | External system connectors | Payment Gateway, Email Service, Third-party APIs |
| **shared** | Cross-cutting components | Logging, Configuration, Utilities |

### Block Specification Schema

```yaml
building_block:
  # Identity
  name: "string - clear, descriptive name"
  id: "string - unique identifier (e.g., BB-001)"
  type: "frontend | backend | infrastructure | integration | shared"

  # Description
  description: "string - what this block does and why"
  responsibilities:
    - "string - specific responsibility 1"
    - "string - specific responsibility 2"

  # Dependencies
  dependencies:
    internal:
      - block_id: "BB-XXX"
        type: "required | optional"
        interface: "interface name"
    external:
      - name: "PostgreSQL"
        version: ">=14.0"
        purpose: "Primary data storage"

  # Interfaces
  interfaces:
    api_endpoints:
      - method: "GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE"
        path: "/api/v1/resource"
        description: "What this endpoint does"
        request_schema: "schema reference or inline"
        response_schema: "schema reference or inline"
        auth_required: true | false

    events_published:
      - name: "event.name"
        description: "When this event is emitted"
        payload_schema: "schema reference"

    events_consumed:
      - name: "event.name"
        description: "How this block responds"

    data_contracts:
      - name: "Contract name"
        description: "Data structure shared"
        schema: "schema reference"

  # Estimation
  complexity: "S | M | L | XL"
  estimated_hours: number
  story_points: number

  # Quality
  test_criteria:
    - "string - acceptance criterion 1"
    - "string - acceptance criterion 2"

  # Metadata
  priority: "critical | high | medium | low"
  sprint_assignment: "Sprint N"
  owner: "string - responsible team/person"
```

### Complexity Guidelines

| Complexity | Hours | Story Points | Characteristics |
|------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **S (Small)** | 4-8 | 1-2 | Single responsibility, minimal dependencies, straightforward implementation |
| **M (Medium)** | 16-24 | 3-5 | Multiple responsibilities, some dependencies, standard patterns |
| **L (Large)** | 32-48 | 8-13 | Complex logic, multiple dependencies, custom implementations |
| **XL (Extra Large)** | 48-80 | 13-21 | Highly complex, many dependencies, novel solutions needed |

## Decomposition Process

### Step 1: Identify Domains

Start with domain-driven decomposition:

1. **List core domains** - What are the main business areas?
2. **Identify bounded contexts** - Where are the natural boundaries?
3. **Map domain interactions** - How do domains communicate?

### Step 2: Extract Components

For each domain, identify components:

**Questions to ask:**
- What are the distinct responsibilities?
- What could be built and deployed independently?
- What has different scaling characteristics?
- What changes together vs. changes independently?

### Step 3: Define Interfaces

For each component:

1. **API Contracts** - REST endpoints, GraphQL operations
2. **Event Contracts** - Messages published/consumed
3. **Data Contracts** - Shared data structures

### Step 4: Map Dependencies

Create a dependency graph:

```
BB-001 (Auth) ← BB-002 (User Service)
                    ↑
              BB-003 (API Gateway)
                    ↑
              BB-004 (Frontend)
```

**Dependency Rules:**
- No circular dependencies
- Minimize dependency chains
- Shared components at the bottom
- Infrastructure before business logic

### Step 5: Estimate Effort

For each block:

1. Review similar past work
2. Consider complexity factors
3. Apply team velocity adjustments
4. Add buffer for unknowns (20-30%)

## Quality Checklist

Before completing building blocks specification:

- [ ] All system functionality covered by blocks
- [ ] No overlapping responsibilities between blocks
- [ ] Dependencies form DAG (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] All interfaces specified with schemas
- [ ] Complexity estimates are realistic
- [ ] Test criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Build order respects dependencies
- [ ] Shared/infrastructure blocks identified
- [ ] Dependency diagram generated

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Keep blocks focused (single responsibility)
- Make blocks independently testable
- Define interfaces before implementation details
- Include error handling in test criteria
- Version interface contracts
- Document why blocks are separated

### Don'ts
- Don't create blocks that are too small (< 4 hours)
- Don't create blocks that are too large (> 80 hours)
- Don't have hidden dependencies
- Don't specify implementation details in interfaces
- Don't skip test criteria
- Don't forget infrastructure blocks
