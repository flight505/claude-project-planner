# Project Plan Review and Validation

## Overview

Plan review is a systematic process for evaluating project plans and specifications. Assess architecture decisions, building blocks, sprint plans, cost estimates, risk assessments, and implementation roadmaps. Apply this skill to validate project plans before implementation begins.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Reviewing completed project plans and specifications
- Validating architecture decisions and technology choices
- Assessing building block specifications for completeness
- Reviewing sprint plans and user stories for INVEST criteria
- Validating cost estimates and ROI projections
- Evaluating risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Providing constructive feedback on implementation roadmaps

## Visual Enhancement with Project Diagrams

**When creating review documents, consider adding diagrams to enhance communication.**

Use the **project-diagrams** skill to generate:
- Architecture review diagrams highlighting concerns
- Dependency analysis visualizations
- Sprint timeline charts
- Risk heat maps
- Cost breakdown charts

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "diagram description" -o diagrams/output.png
```

## Plan Review Workflow

Conduct plan review systematically through the following stages.

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment

Begin with a high-level evaluation to determine the plan's scope, completeness, and overall quality.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the project's core objective and value proposition?
- Are all major deliverables and milestones identified?
- Is the scope realistic for the proposed timeline and resources?
- Are there any immediate major gaps or inconsistencies?

**Output:** Brief summary (2-3 sentences) capturing the plan's essence and initial impression.

### Stage 2: Architecture Review

Evaluate the system architecture and technology decisions.

#### Technology Stack Assessment
- **Appropriateness:** Is the stack suitable for the project's requirements?
- **Maturity:** Are chosen technologies production-ready and well-supported?
- **Team Skills:** Does the team have expertise with the chosen stack?
- **Scalability:** Can the architecture handle projected growth?
- **Cost:** Are there hidden costs or vendor lock-in risks?

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Are major decisions documented with context and rationale?
- Are alternatives considered and trade-offs discussed?
- Are decisions traceable to requirements?

#### Component Design
- Is the system properly decomposed into logical components?
- Are component boundaries clear and responsibilities well-defined?
- Are interfaces between components specified?
- Are there circular dependencies or tight coupling concerns?

### Stage 3: Building Block Specification Review

Evaluate each building block for completeness and buildability.

**For each building block, verify:**

#### Specification Completeness
- [ ] Clear name and description
- [ ] Type identified (frontend, backend, infrastructure, integration, shared)
- [ ] Responsibilities listed (specific, not vague)
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Interfaces defined (API endpoints, events, data contracts)
- [ ] Complexity estimate (S, M, L, XL)
- [ ] Estimated hours/story points
- [ ] Test criteria specified

#### Buildability Assessment
- Can Claude Code build this block independently?
- Are all prerequisites and dependencies available?
- Is the scope small enough for incremental delivery?
- Are acceptance criteria testable?

#### Interface Contracts
- Are API endpoints RESTful with proper HTTP methods?
- Are request/response schemas defined?
- Are error responses specified?
- Are events and messages well-documented?

### Stage 4: Sprint Plan Review

Evaluate sprint plans for feasibility and INVEST criteria.

#### Sprint Structure
- **Goals:** Are sprint goals clear, measurable, and achievable?
- **Duration:** Is the sprint duration realistic (typically 1-2 weeks)?
- **Scope:** Is the sprint scope appropriate for the team capacity?
- **Dependencies:** Are inter-sprint dependencies identified?

#### User Stories Assessment (INVEST Criteria)

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Independent** | Can this story be delivered without other stories? |
| **Negotiable** | Is the scope flexible based on feedback? |
| **Valuable** | Does it deliver value to users or stakeholders? |
| **Estimable** | Can effort be reasonably estimated? |
| **Small** | Can it be completed within a sprint? |
| **Testable** | Are acceptance criteria clear and testable? |

#### Story Quality Checklist
- [ ] Clear "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Story points are assigned
- [ ] Building block association is specified
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Priority is assigned

### Stage 5: Cost Analysis Review

Evaluate cost estimates and financial projections.

#### Service Cost Verification
- Are estimates based on current pricing (not outdated)?
- Are pricing sources documented?
- Are usage assumptions realistic?
- Are low/mid/high scenarios provided?

#### Cost Categories to Verify
- [ ] Infrastructure costs (compute, storage, networking)
- [ ] Third-party service costs (APIs, SaaS)
- [ ] Development tool costs (CI/CD, monitoring)
- [ ] Licensing costs
- [ ] Personnel costs (if applicable)
- [ ] Contingency buffer (typically 15-25%)

#### ROI Assessment
- Are revenue projections realistic and justified?
- Is the payback period calculated correctly?
- Are growth assumptions documented?
- Are comparable market data referenced?

### Stage 6: Risk Assessment Review

Evaluate risk identification and mitigation strategies.

#### Risk Register Completeness
- [ ] Risks categorized (technical, business, resource, external, security)
- [ ] Likelihood assessed (low, medium, high)
- [ ] Impact assessed (low, medium, high)
- [ ] Risk scores calculated
- [ ] Mitigation strategies defined
- [ ] Contingency plans documented
- [ ] Risk owners assigned

#### Risk Coverage Assessment
**Verify these common risk categories are addressed:**

| Category | Example Risks |
|----------|--------------|
| Technical | Integration failures, scalability issues, technical debt |
| Security | Data breaches, authentication vulnerabilities |
| Resource | Key person dependency, skill gaps, turnover |
| External | Third-party API changes, regulatory changes |
| Business | Market changes, competitor actions, budget cuts |
| Timeline | Scope creep, dependency delays, underestimation |

#### Mitigation Quality
- Are mitigations actionable and specific?
- Are contingency plans realistic?
- Is residual risk acceptable?

### Stage 7: Timeline and Milestone Review

Evaluate the implementation timeline.

#### Timeline Realism
- Are duration estimates realistic based on complexity?
- Is there adequate buffer for uncertainties (20-30%)?
- Are holidays and team availability considered?
- Are external dependencies factored in?
