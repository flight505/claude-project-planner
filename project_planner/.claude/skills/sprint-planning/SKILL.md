# Sprint Planning

## Overview

Sprint planning is the process of breaking project work into time-boxed iterations with clear goals and deliverables. Create user stories following INVEST criteria, manage sprint capacity, define acceptance criteria, and track dependencies for successful incremental delivery.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Breaking building blocks into user stories
- Planning sprint backlogs and goals
- Estimating story points and capacity
- Defining acceptance criteria
- Identifying and managing dependencies
- Creating release roadmaps

## Visual Enhancement with Project Diagrams

**When documenting sprint plans, include visualizations.**

Use the **project-diagrams** skill to generate:
- Sprint timeline/Gantt charts
- Dependency graphs between stories
- Velocity and burndown projections
- Release roadmap diagrams

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "diagram description" -o diagrams/output.png
```

## Sprint Planning Framework

### Sprint Structure

```yaml
sprint:
  sprint_number: N
  name: "Descriptive Sprint Name"
  duration_weeks: 1 | 2  # Standard sprint length

  dates:
    start: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    end: "YYYY-MM-DD"

  goals:
    - "Primary goal - what we're trying to achieve"
    - "Secondary goal"

  capacity:
    team_size: N
    available_points: N  # Based on team velocity
    committed_points: N  # Should be <= available

  deliverables:
    - "Concrete deliverable 1"
    - "Concrete deliverable 2"

  stories: []  # List of user stories

  dependencies:
    incoming:
      - sprint: N-1
        items: ["What must be done before this sprint"]
    outgoing:
      - sprint: N+1
        items: ["What this sprint enables"]

  risks:
    - "Sprint-specific risk and mitigation"
```

### User Story Format

**Standard Format:**
```
As a [type of user],
I want [some goal/action],
So that [benefit/reason].
```

**User Story Specification:**

```yaml
story:
  id: "US-NNN"
  title: "Short descriptive title"

  description: |
    As a [user type],
    I want [action],
    So that [benefit].

  acceptance_criteria:
    - given: "Initial context"
      when: "Action taken"
      then: "Expected outcome"
    - "Simple criterion format also acceptable"

  story_points: 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13  # Fibonacci
  priority: "critical | high | medium | low"

  building_block: "BB-NNN"  # Related building block

  dependencies:
    - story_id: "US-XXX"
      type: "blocks | informs"

  technical_notes: |
    Implementation guidance for developers

  design_link: "URL to mockups/designs (if applicable)"
```

### INVEST Criteria

Every user story should satisfy INVEST:

| Criterion | Description | Validation Question |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **I**ndependent | Can be developed and delivered separately | Can we release this without other stories? |
| **N**egotiable | Details can be discussed and adjusted | Are we focused on the "what" not "how"? |
| **V**aluable | Delivers value to users or business | Would a stakeholder care about this? |
| **E**stimable | Can be reasonably estimated | Do we understand it well enough to estimate? |
| **S**mall | Fits within a single sprint | Can we complete this in the sprint? |
| **T**estable | Has clear acceptance criteria | Can we write tests for this? |

### Story Point Estimation

**Fibonacci Scale Reference:**

| Points | Complexity | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial | Text change, simple config |
| 2 | Simple | Single function, minor UI change |
| 3 | Moderate | Feature with some logic, API endpoint |
| 5 | Complex | Multi-component feature, integration |
| 8 | Very Complex | Large feature, significant coordination |
| 13 | Epic-sized | Consider breaking down further |

**Estimation Factors:**
- Complexity of logic
- Number of components touched
- Testing effort required
- Uncertainty/unknowns
- Dependencies on others
- Technical risk

### Capacity Planning

**Team Velocity Calculation:**
```
Available Points = Team Size × Average Points Per Person Per Sprint

Typical: 8-12 points per developer per 2-week sprint
```

**Capacity Buffer:**
```yaml
capacity_allocation:
  new_development: 70%  # User stories
  bugs_and_maintenance: 15%
  meetings_and_overhead: 15%
```

**Leave Buffer:**
- Account for holidays, PTO, sick days
- Reduce capacity proportionally

## Sprint Planning Process

### Phase 1: Backlog Preparation

**Before sprint planning:**

1. **Groom Backlog**
   - Ensure stories have acceptance criteria
   - Verify estimates are up-to-date
   - Clarify dependencies
   - Prioritize based on business value

2. **Review Building Blocks**
   - Which blocks are ready to work on?
   - What dependencies are resolved?
   - What technical decisions are made?

### Phase 2: Sprint Goal Definition

1. **Set Clear Goals**
   - What capability will be delivered?
   - How does this advance the project?
   - What is NOT in scope?

2. **Define Deliverables**
   - Concrete outputs, not activities
   - Measurable completion criteria
   - Demo-able functionality

### Phase 3: Story Selection

1. **Pull from prioritized backlog**
2. **Check dependencies**
3. **Verify capacity fit**
4. **Balance across team members**
5. **Include buffer for unknowns**

### Phase 4: Dependency Mapping

```yaml
dependency_types:
  blocks: "Cannot start until X completes"
  informs: "Better if X completes first, but can work around"
  enables: "Completing this enables future work"
```

**Dependency Rules:**
- No circular dependencies within sprint
- Minimize cross-sprint dependencies
- Front-load high-dependency items
- Identify blockers early

## Story Templates

### Feature Story

```yaml
story:
  id: "US-001"
  title: "User Login with Email/Password"

  description: |
    As a registered user,
    I want to log in with my email and password,
    So that I can access my account and personal data.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - given: "I am on the login page"
      when: "I enter valid email and password and click Login"
      then: "I am redirected to the dashboard"

    - given: "I am on the login page"
      when: "I enter invalid credentials and click Login"
      then: "I see an error message 'Invalid email or password'"

    - given: "I am on the login page"
      when: "I enter email without password and click Login"
      then: "I see a validation error for required password"

    - "Login button is disabled during authentication request"
    - "Session persists across browser refresh"

  story_points: 5
  priority: "critical"
  building_block: "BB-001"

## Quality Checklist

Before completing sprint planning:

- [ ] All stories follow INVEST criteria
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Story points estimated using Fibonacci scale
- [ ] Dependencies mapped and respected
- [ ] Capacity not over-committed (leave 20% buffer)
- [ ] Sprint goals are clear and measurable
- [ ] Deliverables are concrete
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] All building blocks covered across sprints

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Keep sprints to 1-2 weeks
- Set clear, achievable sprint goals
- Leave buffer for unknowns (15-20%)
- Front-load high-risk items
- Include infrastructure and tech debt
- Review and adjust velocity over time

### Don'ts
- Don't over-commit capacity
- Don't create stories larger than 13 points
- Don't ignore dependencies
- Don't skip acceptance criteria
- Don't plan too far ahead in detail
- Don't forget to include testing time
